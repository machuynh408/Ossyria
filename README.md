# Ossyria

A C# project based on the original source written by Odin. The project files are truncated as I'm only displaying a snippet of the source. If you are a recuriter and are interested in looking at the full source, please message me privately. This was a solo project done completely by me to help me learn the C# language and improve my skills in the areas of Multi-threading and Socket programming. I felt that the original java sources wasn't coded as best as it could, so I took the opportunity to recreate my own version of it, but in a different programming language. The goals of this project was:

- Functional Server
- Performance
- Higher Uptimes
- Stability
